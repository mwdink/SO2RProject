Single Operator 2 Radio (SO2R) Controller

This device allows the operator to interface two radios
with a single pair of headphones, CW key, PTT line, 
and/or microphone. The device is controlled either by 
commands from the logging program or by manual switches. 
The audio from the two radios can be split between the 
left/right headphones.
